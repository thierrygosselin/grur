The name **grur** |ɡro͞oˈr| was chosen because the missing genotypes dilemma with
RADseq data reminds me of the cheese paradox. 

Here, I don't want to sustain a
[war](http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-eco/2012/12/07/97002-20121207FILWWW00487-le-gruyere-francais-doit-avoir-des-trous.php)
or the controversy of cheese with holes,
so choose as you like, the *French Gruyère* or the *Swiss Emmental*.
The paradox is that the more cheese you have the more holes you'll get.
But, the more holes you have means the less cheese you have...
So, someone could conclude, the more cheese = the less cheese ?
I'll leave that up to you, back to genomics...

Numerous genomic analysis are vulnerable to missing values,
don't get trapped by missing genotypes in your RADseq dataset.

Use **grur** to **visualize patterns of missingness** and 
**perform map-independent imputations of missing genotypes** 
(see [features](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/grur#features) below).



## Installation
To try out the dev version of **grur**, copy/paste the code below:

```r
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools") # to install
devtools::install_github("thierrygosselin/grur")
library(grur)
```

#### Troubleshooting
  * **Parallel computing**: [Follow these steps (~ 5 min)](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/grur/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_imputations_parallel.Rmd) to install [randomForestSRC](http://www.ccs.miami.edu/~hishwaran/rfsrc.html) and [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) packages to really work in parallel.
  * [Installation problems.](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/grur/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_installation_problems.Rmd)
  * **Windows users**: Install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
  * The R GUI is unstable with functions using parallel ([more info](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/html/mclapply.html)), so I recommend using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) for a better experience.

## Features
| Caracteristics | Description |
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
|**Simulate RADseq data**|`simulate_rad`: simulate populations of RADseq data following island or stepping stone models. Inside the function, allele frequency can be created with [fastsimcoal2](http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/fastsimcoal2/) and then use inside [rmetasim](https://github.com/stranda/rmetasim) simulation engine. *Vignette coming soon*.|
|**Patterns of missingness**|`missing_visualization`: visualize patterns of missing data associated with different variables of your study (lanes, chips, sequencers, populations, sample sites, reads/samples, homozygosity, etc). Similar to PLINK's identify-by-missingness analysis (IBM), **grur** is more powerful because it generates more analysis and automatically creates tables and figures. Vignette: [html](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4zf032g6yjatj0a/vignette_missing_data_analysis.nb.html?dl=0) and [Rmd](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5fxw2h9w1l1j391/vignette_missing_data_analysis.Rmd?dl=0)<br><br>`generate_missing`: allows to generate missing genotypes in dateset [simulated] based on a compound Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. *Vignette coming soon*.|
|**Imputations**|`grur_imputations`: **Map-independent** imputations of missing genotypes with several algorithms:<br> * **Random Forests** (on-the-fly-imputations or using predictive modelling),<br>* **Extreme Gradient Tree Boosting,**<br>* **Classic Strawman: ** the most frequently observed, non-missing, genotypes is used for imputation.<br><br>**Hierarchy: ** algorithm's model can account for *population* groupings or not (i.e. *overall samples*).<br><br>**Haplotype: ** automatically detect SNPs on the same LOCUS (read/haplotype) to impute the SNPs jointly, reducing imputation artifacts. *Vignette coming soon*.|
| **Input/Output** | The imputations offered in **grur** are seamlesly integrated in **stackr** and **assigner**. Imputations are also integrated with usefull filters, blacklist and whitelist inside those 2 packages. Genetic formats recognized: [VCF, SNPs and haplotypes](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/), [PLINK tped/tfam](http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/data.shtml#tr), [genind](https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet), [genlight](https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet), [strataG gtypes](https://github.com/EricArcher/strataG), [Genepop](http://genepop.curtin.edu.au), [STACKS haplotype file](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/), [hierfstat](https://github.com/jgx65/hierfstat), [COLONY](https://www.zsl.org/science/software/colony), [betadiv](http://adn.biol.umontreal.ca/~numericalecology/Rcode/), [δaδi](http://gutengroup.mcb.arizona.edu/software/), [structure](http://pritchardlab.stanford.edu/structure.html), [Arlequin](http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/arlequin35/), [SNPRelate](https://github.com/zhengxwen/SNPRelate), dataframes of genotypes in wide or long/tidy format.|
|**[ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org)-based plotting**|Visualization: publication-ready figures of important metrics and statistics.|
|**Parallel**|Codes designed and optimized for fast computations with progress bars. Works with all OS: Linux, Mac and yes PC!|

## Vignettes and examples

Vignettes with real data for example in the form of R Notebooks take too much
space to be included in package, without CRAN complaining.
Consequently, vignettes will start to be distributed separately, follow the links below.

## New features
Change log, version, new features and bug history lives in the [NEWS.md file](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/grur/blob/master/NEWS.md)

**v.0.0.3 2017-06-17**

* `simulate_rad`: a new function developed by Eric Archer to simulate populations
of RADseq data following **island** or **stepping** stone models.
* **grur** works with `dplyr v.0.7.0`


**v.0.0.2 2017-04-23**

* Work on `generate_missing` function.
* Still not as I wish. But getting there.
* 2 new functions: `imputations_accuracy` and `memorize_missing`. Check functions
documentations for more info.

**v.0.0.1 2017-04-07**

* **grur** package launch!


#### Roadmap of future developments

* Integrate more imputation method.
* Workflow tutorial and vignettes to further explore some problems.
* Use Shiny and ggvis (when subplots and/or facets becomes available for ggvis).
* Until publication **grur** will change rapidly, stay updated with releases and contribute with bug reports.
* Suggestions ?


#### Contributions

This package has been developed in the open, and it wouldn’t be nearly as good without your contributions. There are a number of ways you can help me make this package even better:

* If you don’t understand something, please let me know and raise an [issue](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/grur/issues)
* Your feedback on what is confusing or hard to understand is valuable. 
* If you spot a typo, feel free to edit the underlying page and send a pull request.
* New to pull request on github ? [The process is very easy](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html#git-pullreq).
